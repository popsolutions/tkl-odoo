Odoo - From ERP to CRM, eCommerce to CMS
========================================

`Odoo`_ is an all-in-one business management suite of mobile-friendly web
apps that integrates everything you need to grow your business: CRM,
website content management, project management, human resources,
accounting, invoicing and more. Odoo apps integrate seamlessly to
provide a full-featured open source ERP, but can also be used
stand-alone. Python programmers can develop their own app modules, or
choose from an array of free open source such as those provided by OCA_;
or paid commercial ones.

This appliance includes all the standard features in `TurnKey Core`_:

- Odoo configurations for TurnKey v18.x:

    - Odoo v16 installed from debian backports apt repo (v18.x).
    - Includes modules from base install of Odoo.

- **Security note**: As of 18.0, due to using the debian backports repo
  Updates to Odoo **ARE NOT** configured to install automatically.

- SSL support out of the box.
- `Adminer`_ administration frontend for PostgreSQL (listening on
  port 12322 - uses SSL).
- Webmin modules for configuring Apache2, PostgreSQL and Postfix.
